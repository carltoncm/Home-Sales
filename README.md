# Home-Sales
This repository is for the Data Analytics Bootcamp Module 22 Challenge-Big Data

In this challenge, I used my knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. I used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table was uncached.

I referenced class activities and instruction provided by Instructor Brett Barnes and TA Ally Qi to complete this activity.
I also referenced this site for SQL query building (https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-date-functions/how-to-extract-year-from-date-in-sql/)
